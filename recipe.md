Mix the dough ingredients together by hand or use a hand-held or stand mixer. Do this in steps as described in the written recipe below. Knead by hand or beat the dough with your mixer. I like doing this by hand and you can watch me in the video. Place dough into a greased mixing bowl, cover tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator. Punch down risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide in 2. Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Cover and rest as you prep the pizza toppings. Top with favorite pizza toppings. Bake pizza at a very high temperature for only about 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the pizza base when the dough is ready. Dust the space a little using dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base is even at all ends.) Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven and bake it 10 minutes. Now, your pizza base is ready.
